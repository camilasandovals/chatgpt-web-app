            <p>Our platform offers a safe and confidential space for you to discuss your concerns with an AI-based therapist that uses GPT-3 technology. It aims to provide personalized and supportive guidance to help you manage and overcome multiple issues.</p>

            <p>
            To use our app, simply type in your concern or issue in the prompt box and hit send. Our AI-based therapist will generate a response in real-time, simulating a real human therapist. The more information you provide, the more personalized and effective the response will be. Please keep in mind that while our app offers guidance and support, it is not a replacement for professional therapy. If you are in crisis or need urgent help, please contact your local emergency services or seek help from a licensed mental health professional.
